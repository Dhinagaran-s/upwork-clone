#### A few notes about this project. (1) Aesthetically it is a simple clone of upwork.com's 'How It Works' page: https://www.upwork.com/i/how-it-works/client/. Upwork is a site that connects freelance developers with projects. (2) This is a code school project meant to demonstrate understanding of basic Angular CRUD functionality. It allows users to create and read faux web and software development projects. The projects are stored as objects in Google's NoSQL database, Firebase. User authentication is also functional. Users may create accounts using email and password.

## Other active features and functionality

- Users may navigate between six pages:
1. Home
2. Projects
3. Login (modal window)
4. Sign up (modal window)
5. Make an API call (not functional as of this writing)
6. Admin (currently accessible by all users).
- All projects listed on list-project page.
- Display project detail on project detail page.
- User may post job via post job button.
- Projects displayed on Admin page.  
- Admin may add, edit, and delete project.
