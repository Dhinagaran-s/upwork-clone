# UPWORK CLONE

## March 30, 2018

####  by John Rykken

#### There are two notes about this project. (1) Aesthetically it is a simple clone of upwork.com, https://www.upwork.com/i/how-it-works/client/, a site that connects freelance developers with projects. (2) This is a code school project meant to demonstrate understanding of basic Angular CRUD functionality.
