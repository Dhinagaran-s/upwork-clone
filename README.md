# UPWORK CLONE

## March 30, 2018

#### John Rykken

#### This simple, single-page website is a super basic clone of upwork.com, which is a site that connects freelance developers with projects. I used angular to build it. It isn't practically useful in any way. My focus was deepening my understanding of angular components, inputs and inputs, property bindings, and so on and so forth. I do hope to implement, at minimum, a search box, a pseudo login-slash-signup page, and a job posting page.

* When navbar option clicked, display info via z-index. E.g. "student project, no information available"
* Build 'tabs section on main page'. Include three tabs. 'If you're hiring.' 'If you're freelancing.' 'FAQs.'
* Create jumbotron with a 'How It Works' title and a responsive 'Get Started' button.
* Clone the two columns directly beneath the jumbotron. Clone the page down to, but not beyond, the upworks paragraph titled 'Hire the best freelancer'.
