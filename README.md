## March 30, 2018

####  by John Rykken

#### There are two notes about this project. (1) Aesthetically it is a simple clone of upwork.com's 'How It Works' page: https://www.upwork.com/i/how-it-works/client/. Upwork is a site that connects freelance developers with projects. (2) This is a code school project meant to demonstrate understanding of basic Angular CRUD functionality. It allows users to create and read faux web and software development projects. The projects are stored as objects in Google's NoSQL database, Firebase. User authentication is also functional. Users may create accounts using email and password.
